# There is a method/function called multiply_numbers. It holds three values or inputs. These are first_number, second_number, and third_number.
#Within the method, the three numbers are multiplied and then put onto the screen.
#The method then ends. The method is then called. The three numbers needed to complete the mathematical process inside the method are set. 
# The final output to the screen would be the number 24.
